## Technical Feasibility Analysis

### 🟢 Highly Feasible Components

#### 1. Browser Engine
- **GeckoView**: Mozilla's Android-focused browser engine
  - Pros: Full control, privacy-focused, extensive customization, designed for embedding
  - Cons: Larger app size (40MB+), less web compatibility, fewer active users
  - Current state: Active development but limited market adoption
- **Chromium WebView**: Google's web engine
  - Pros: Better web compatibility, smaller footprint, wider ecosystem support
  - Cons: Limited customization, Google dependencies, security restrictions
  - Current state: Google developing "Desktop Android" builds with extension support

**Major Update (2024-2025)**: Google is actively developing desktop-style Chrome for Android with full extension support, primarily targeting large-screen devices and future Android PCs. This could significantly benefit NeoDev Browser.

**Recommendation**: Start with Chromium WebView for MVP, leverage Google's Desktop Android Chrome builds for advanced features.

#### 2. Code Editor Integration
- **Monaco Editor**: VS Code's editor engine
