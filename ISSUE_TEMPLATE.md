  If this is a performance issue report, please use the VS Code Issue reporter via command palette (f1 -> Help: Report Issue).
  Set the field 'This is a' to be 'Performance Issue', the field 'File on' to be 'An Extension', and set 'Extension' to be 'C/C++'.
  You may toggle off the data you wish to not send, but with more information we can help. 
  Fill out the title and steps to reproduce with as much info as you can.
  Clicking on 'Preview on GitHub' will open up a webpage for you to submit your issue.

  If this is a bug report, please give us as much information as possible so we can reproduce your issue.
  Examples of information that can help us find and fix bugs:
    * Operating System and version
    * VS Code version and if you are using the Insiders build
    * C/C++ extension version
    * Other extensions you installed and if the issue persists after disabling them
    * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
    * A small code sample, zipped up project, or open source repo we can use to verify the bug
    * Relevant settings from your settings.json, c_cpp_properties.json, and/or launch.json files
    * Any log messages present in the Output window (use "C_Cpp.loggingLevel": "Information" in settings.json)
    * Debugger logs (use "logging": { "engineLogging": true } in your launch.json)

  Call Stacks: For bugs like crashes, deadlocks, infinite loops, etc. that we are not able to repro and for which the call stack may be useful, please attach a debugger and/or create a dmp and provide the call stacks. Starting with 0.17.3, Windows binaries have symbols available in VS Code by setting your "symbolSearchPath" to "http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols".

  Please also take a look at our documentation, as we may already have answers for your questions:
