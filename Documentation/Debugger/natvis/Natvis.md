# Natvis - Custom views for native objects

The Natvis framework allows developers to write custom schemas to help visualize native objects.

For gdb/lldb debugging (`"type": "cppdbg"`), a subset of the Natvis framework has been ported to the C/C++ extension and the code resides in the [MIEngine](https://github.com/Microsoft/MIEngine) shared component. If additional features that are not implemented are requested, please file an [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/MIEngine/issues) on the MIEngine GitHub page with details of what is missing.

For Visual C++ debugging (`"type": "cppvsdbg"`), the debugger contains the full implementation of the Natvis framework as Visual Studio.
