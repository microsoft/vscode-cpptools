Providing call stacks:
For bugs like crashes, deadlocks, infinite loops, etc. that we are not able to repro and for which the call stack may be useful, please attach a debugger and/or create a dmp and provide the call stacks. Windows binaries have symbols available in VS Code by setting your "symbolSearchPath" to "https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols".
