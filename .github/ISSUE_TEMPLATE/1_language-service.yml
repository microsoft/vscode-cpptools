      Optionally provide other information that will give us more context about the issue you are encountering, such as code sample, screenshots, screen recording of the issue, call stacks, etc.
      
      Providing call stacks:
      For bugs like crashes, deadlocks, infinite loops, etc. that we are not able to repro and for which the call stack may be useful, please attach a debugger and/or create a dmp and provide the call stacks. Windows binaries have symbols available in VS Code by setting your "symbolSearchPath" to "https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols".
