### Potentially Breaking Changes
* Settings `commentContinuationPatterns`, `enhancedColorization`, and `codeFolding` are no longer available in per-Folder settings (only Workspace or higher settings). [PR #5830](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/pull/5830)
* Fix compile command arguments not being used when `compilerPath` is set (so the compile command arguments need to be compatible now).
* If a non-matching `intelliSenseMode` was being used, such as clang-x64 with a gcc ARM compiler, then we may auto-fix it internally, which may cause changes to IntelliSense behavior.

### Known Issues
* Using `clang-format` on ARM may require installing libtinfo5. [#5958](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/5958)
